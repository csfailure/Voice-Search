# Voice-Search
Use your voice to open Youtube, Google or Soundcloud content <br />

This python and selenium script uses Google voice recorder to search what you would usually type in Google Chrome <br />

NOTE: The app works with Chrome Webdriver and you have to make sure you install it in any directory, and write the location in the code <br />
 
Also make sure your Voice Recorder is allowed to access the microphone <br />

you can download the webdriver here: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads <br />

if your first word is Youtube/SoundCloud/Google and the others are your search keyword, Chrome will open a window either in Youtube/SoundCloud/Google and open the keyword that you said. <br />
It won't work if the first words are not Youtube/SoundCloud/Google
